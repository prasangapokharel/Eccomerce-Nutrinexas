Here is the **clean, simple, real Flipkart-style explanation** of **Search Ads Product Format + Formula + Ranking Logic**.
This is the system Flipkart, Amazon, and Daraz follow.

---

# ✅ **1. What Is Search Ads Product (Flipkart Style)?**

When a user searches “mobile”, Flipkart mixes **paid products** inside the search result list.

These paid products show a small **“Sponsored”** badge.

Placement looks natural so the user clicks more.

---

# ✅ **2. Where Flipkart Shows Search Ads**

Flipkart inserts sponsored products at fixed intervals:

* **1st position**
* **3rd position**
* **6th position**
* Then every **10th** position
* Only inside search relevant products

This gives the highest click rate.

---

# ✅ **3. Flipkart Search Ads Formula (Ranking Rule)**

Flipkart uses a simple weighted formula:

```
Ad Rank = Bid Amount + (Product Score × Weight)
```

Where:

* **Bid Amount** = how much seller paid for search ads
* **Product Score** = (rating + sales + CTR history)
* **Weight** = a small booster value (0.1 to 0.5)

**Higher Ad Rank = Higher position in search.**

---

# ✅ **4. Flipkart Product Score Formula**

This is the simple calculation most marketplaces follow:

```
Product Score = (Rating × 0.6) + (Sales × 0.3) + (CTR × 0.1)
```

Example:

* Rating: 4.5
* Monthly Sales: 320
* CTR: 1.8%

Product score becomes:

```
(4.5 × 0.6) + (320 × 0.3) + (1.8 × 0.1)
≈ 99.08
```

This is optional but helps put ads in better positions.

# ✅ **5. Sponsored Product Display Format (Flipkart Style)**

Your search result product card should include:

* Product image
* Title
* Price
* Rating
* Small label: **Sponsored**
* Highlighted border very thin (only 1px lighter)

**Example Layout:**

```
[ Product Image ]
Product Title  
Rs. 1299  
★★★★☆ (321 reviews)
Sponsored
```

The “Sponsored” badge must be subtle.

---

# ✅ **6. How Flipkart Ensures Results Still Look Real**

Flipkart always mixes:

* Organic products
* Sponsored products
* Best match products

Sponsored products **never fill the whole page**.

Only 10–15% of the search result.

---

# ✅ **7. Easy Version You Can Use for Your System**

Use this logic:

1. Pick **top active ads** for the keyword
2. Sort by **highest bid**
3. Insert at positions:

   * 1
   * 3
   * 6
4. Fill remaining ads every **10th** position
5. Mark with **Sponsored**
6. If no ads, show normal product list

This is lightweight and works perfectly for Nepal ecommerce.
